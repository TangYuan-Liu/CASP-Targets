# Decoy Sets Used in NEPRE
NEPRE uses several excellent decoy sets that generated by some famous research group or competition. Sincerely thanks to their help!
## CASP12
CASP12 contains 146 targets totally. 39 targets which use **X-RAY DIFFRACTION** with resolution **<= 3Ã…** are used to validate NEPRE.  

Total CASP12 Decoy Set can be found by visiting [CASP](http://predictioncenter.org/).  
  
The **39** targets used in NEPRE can be obtained in **casp12.rar**. Figure1 shows a example of target list contained in each decoy folder.

## ROSETTA
The On_Rosetta_set contains structure decoys generated by 3DRobot for 58 proteins that are taken from the orginal Rosetta decoy paper (Simons, et al., JMB, 1997). See details by visiting [ROSETTA.](https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/3DRobot/decoys/)
## MODELLER
The On_Modeller_set contains structure decoys generated by 3DRobot for 20 proteins that are taken from the original Modeller decoy paper (John and Sali, NAR, 2003). See detail by visiting [MODELLER.]()

## 3DRobot
The 3DRobot_set includes structural decoys for 200 non-homologous proteins that are randomly selected from the PDB library. See details by visiting [3DRobot.](https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/3DRobot/decoys/)

## I-TASSER
### I-TASSER(a)
The I-TASSER Decoy Set II is a structurally non-redundant set of protein structures. Each protein target contains 300-500 decoys. Each decoy structure was first generated by I-TASSER Monte Carlo simulations and then refined by GROMACS4.0 MD simulation using OPLS-AA force field with the purpose of removing steric clashes and improving hydrogen-bonding network. See detail by visiting The [I-TASSER Decoy Set II.](https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/decoys/)

### I-TASSER(b)
The On_I-TASSER_set include structure decoys generated by 3DRobot for 56 proteins that are taken from the original I-TASSER decoy paper (Zhang et al, PLoS One, 2011). See details by visiting [On_I-TASSER.](https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/3DRobot/decoys/)
